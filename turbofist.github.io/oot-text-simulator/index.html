      <h2 style="font-size: 32px">FAQ:</h2>
      <div id="usedfor"><h3>Symbols and explanations:</h3>
        <p>The tool shows which screen position the text box is in by showing a white border on one of the sides of the textbox, TEXTBOX_POS_BOTTOM is on the bottom etc.</p>
        <p>BOX_BREAK creates a new box with the contents of the next text box in such a manner that both readability and screen space are considered.</p>
        <p>Icons are supported.</p>
        <p>The spacing is off in certain places (one space more than there should be), this is a known difference and will be fixed.</p>
        <p>Please note that single line text is shown at the top, while rendered towards the middle in-game, this will be fixed.</p>
        <p>Do not enter anything anyone has sent you without reading the code first, XSS is a possibility, however is in practice useless for any attackers. You should be on the safe side however.</p>

        <h3>What is this tool used for?</h3>
        <p>This tool was developed by me under the course of two days because I needed a way to preview the dialogue I was writing in OoT decomp, this tool exculsively previews the text, and is not a text editor for the game, this may change in the future, but for now it is strictly used to get a general idea of what the text boxes will look like in game.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that this tool removes all newlines from the input in the textbox in order to work properly (as of right now), therefore all of the text will be on a single line if copied from the input text area, therefore, please keep your code backed up and do not rely on the tool to keep your code intact, it is simply a viewing tool, <i>not an editor</i>.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>How do I use the tool?</h3>
        <p>Paste a section from message_data.h into the text field to the left, the tool supports everything from "DEFINE_MESSAGE(msgNum, textboxColor, testboxPos" until the end of the text box.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>I want to use this tool for the other languages!</h3>
        <p>Certainly! If you want to use the tool for any of the other languages simply paste the first DEFINE_MESSAGE part and then paste the part of whichever language you desire to use.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Example usage:</h3>
        <p>Copying the following code from message_data.h:</p>
        <pre><code style="font-size: 12px">DEFINE_MESSAGE(0x403B, TEXTBOX_TYPE_BLACK, TEXTBOX_POS_BOTTOM,
"You say you want to buy a " COLOR(BLUE) "Zora\n"
"Tunic" COLOR(DEFAULT) "? That tunic is made of the\n"
"finest material, and is therefore\n"
"exceedingly expensive!"
BOX_BREAK
"In fact, I'm afraid only that " COLOR(RED) "very\n"
"rich family in Kakariko Village " COLOR(DEFAULT) "can\n"
"afford this fine garment..." EVENT</code></pre>
        <p>Shows the two message boxes produced. If we want to view the German text we replace the part containing the English text with the part containing the German text:</p>
        <pre><code style="font-size: 12px">DEFINE_MESSAGE(0x403B, TEXTBOX_TYPE_BLACK, TEXTBOX_POS_BOTTOM,
"Du willst die " COLOR(BLUE) "Zora-Rüstung" COLOR(DEFAULT) " kaufen?\n"
"Sie ist aus edelstem Material und\n"
"daher enorm teuer!"
BOX_BREAK
"Ich schätze, nur " COLOR(RED) "diese sehr\n"
"reiche Familie in Kakariko" COLOR(DEFAULT) " kann\n"
"sie sich leisten." EVENT</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class="textinput"><textarea id="input" onkeydown="updateText()"></textarea></div>
  <div class="warning"><p>Do <b style="color: red">NOT</b> paste anything that isn't either written by you or taken from decomp's message_data.h in the input field, this could possibly result in unwanted behaviour.</p></div>
