      <p>The COLOR command is used in conjunction with any<br>of the available colors to color all text after the command.</p>
      <h3>DEFINE_MESSAGE(textId, type, yPos, nesMessage, gerMessage, fraMessage)</h3>
        <p>textId - The text ID of the text box, which can be used to later use that text box in game</p>
        <p>type - The type of textbox, this controls the background color of the text box.</p>
        <p>yPos - This controls where on screen the box appears.</p>
        <p>nesMessage, gerMessage, fraMessage - These all encompass the actual text along with macros for different things such as colored text and cutscene commands.</p>

      <div id="usedfor"><h3>Symbols and explanations:</h3>
        <p>The tool shows which screen position the text box is in by showing a white border on one of the sides of the textbox, TEXTBOX_POS_BOTTOM is on the bottom etc.</p>
        <p>BOX_BREAK creates a new box with the contents of the next text box in such a manner that both readability and screen space are considered.</p>
        <p>Icons are supported.</p>
        <p>The spacing is off in certain places (one space more than there should be), this is a known difference and will be fixed.</p>
        <p>Please note that single line text is shown at the top, while rendered towards the middle in-game, this will be fixed.</p>
        <p>Do not enter anything anyone has sent you without reading the code first, XSS is a possibility, however is in practice useless for any attackers. You should be on the safe side however.</p>

        <h3>What is this tool used for?</h3>
        <p>This tool was developed by me under the course of two days because I needed a way to preview the dialogue I was writing in OoT decomp, this tool exculsively previews the text, and is not a text editor for the game, this may change in the future, but for now it is strictly used to get a general idea of what the text boxes will look like in game.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>How do I use the tool?</h3>
        <p>Paste a section from message_data.h into the text field to the left, the tool supports everything from "DEFINE_MESSAGE(msgNum, textboxColor, testboxPos" until the end of the text box.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>I want to use this tool for the other languages!</h3>
        <p>Certainly! If you want to use the tool for any of the other languages simply paste the first DEFINE_MESSAGE part and then paste the part of whichever language you desire to use.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Example usage:</h3>
        <p>Copying the following code from message_data.h:</p>
        <pre><code style="font-size: 12px">DEFINE_MESSAGE(0x403B, TEXTBOX_TYPE_BLACK, TEXTBOX_POS_BOTTOM,
"You say you want to buy a " COLOR(BLUE) "Zora\n"
"Tunic" COLOR(DEFAULT) "? That tunic is made of the\n"
"finest material, and is therefore\n"
"exceedingly expensive!"
BOX_BREAK
"In fact, I'm afraid only that " COLOR(RED) "very\n"
"rich family in Kakariko Village " COLOR(DEFAULT) "can\n"
"afford this fine garment..." EVENT</code></pre>
        <p>Shows the two message boxes produced. If we want to view the German text we replace the part containing the English text with the part containing the German text:</p>
        <pre><code style="font-size: 12px">DEFINE_MESSAGE(0x403B, TEXTBOX_TYPE_BLACK, TEXTBOX_POS_BOTTOM,
"Du willst die " COLOR(BLUE) "Zora-Rüstung" COLOR(DEFAULT) " kaufen?\n"
"Sie ist aus edelstem Material und\n"
"daher enorm teuer!"
BOX_BREAK
"Ich schätze, nur " COLOR(RED) "diese sehr\n"
"reiche Familie in Kakariko" COLOR(DEFAULT) " kann\n"
"sie sich leisten." EVENT</code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class="textinput"><textarea id="input" placeholder="Code here..." onkeydown="updateText()"></textarea></div>
  <div class="warning"><p>Do <b style="color: red">NOT</b> paste anything that isn't either written by you or taken from decomp's message_data.h in the input field, this could possibly result in unwanted behaviour.</p></div>
